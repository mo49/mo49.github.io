GPGPU, compute shader is used to represent the fish school that swim based on the swarm algorithm and trail particle. The wire frame in the latter half of the video is also implemented with ShaderLab, and it is emitted by the post process in Unity. And the camera work is created on Timeline and Cinemachine, and the scene is shot almost once. Finally what I adjusted on After Effects is simple noise expression and time-remapping.",
